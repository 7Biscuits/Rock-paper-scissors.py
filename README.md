# Rock-paper-scissors.py

Made Rock paper scissor game using python and python's random.

How It Works:
-It asks the user wether he would choose rock, paper or scissor.
-If the random result = the user's input it prints "Tie!!"
-Otherwise it prints result according to the user's input and random result. For example:

user's input = "Paper"
random result = "Rock"
output = "You won!!"
